# hello-world
A repo of Vasi's ML resources

Hi fellas
My name is Vasi and my credentials are bachelors in math and dual masters in mathematics and business analytics.

I find making sense of data using visualization, testing hypothesis and assessing significance using statistical methods, and predicting/classifying/clustering things using machine learning techniques, very enthralling.

I help businesses use data wisely and build scalable end-to-end data pipelines. Also I am keen to bridge the gap between data science/analytics team and management by acting as an educator and analytics leader so as to build data culture in the organization. 

On the academic side, Mathematics gives me immense pleasure. Although I am passionate about all of mathematics, but my research interest are linear algebra and topology. Lately I'm also very intrigued by knot theory and chaos theory.

I am also interested in research in deep learning, specifically in building the solid mathematical foundation for many black-box DL ,techniques and generalization and optimization of these algorithms.

If you have any business or research projects, please feel free to reach out at rahman.vasi@gmail.com
